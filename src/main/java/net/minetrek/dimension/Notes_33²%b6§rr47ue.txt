    This file will hopefully not compile into the mod jar
    if it does...STOP READING MY NOTES!!! Nothing important here!!!
    Finally got time to work on the mod again. Yay. My to-do list of things we might see in the next update:

- make phasers work in multiplayer

- some improvments in the code so the mod loads (a little bit) faster and the code is easier to read

- remove gravity in space

- in-game guide (allot of requests for this)

- implementation of energy system

- A Surprise   ---Fake bluescreen---

- MORE THINGS
